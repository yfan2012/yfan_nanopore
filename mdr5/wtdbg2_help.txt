   By default, wtdbg will keep only the best alignment between two reads after chainning. This option will disable it, and keep multiple
 --verbose +
   See -v. -vvvv will display the most detailed information
 --quiet
   See -q
 --limit-input <int>
   Limit the input sequences to at most <int> M bp. Usually for test
 -L <int>, --tidy-reads <int>
   Default: 0. Pick longest subreads if possible. Filter reads less than <--tidy-reads>. Rename reads into 'S%010d' format. The first read is named as S0000000001
   Set to 0 bp to disable tidy. Suggested vaule is 5000 for pacbio RSII reads
 --keep-name
   Keep orignal read names even with --tidy-reads, '-L 5000 --keep-name' equals '-L -5000'
 -g <number>, --genome-size <number>
   Provide genome size, e.g. 100.4m, 2.3g. In this version, it is used with -X/--rdcov-cutoff in selecting reads just after readed all.
 -X <float>, --rdcov-cutoff <float>
   Default: 50.0. Retaining 50.0 folds of genome coverage, combined with -g and --rdcov-filter.
 --rdcov-filter [0|1]
   Default 0. Strategy 0: retaining longest reads. Strategy 1: retaining medain length reads. 
 --err-free-nodes
   Select nodes from error-free-sequences only. E.g. you have contigs assembled from NGS-WGS reads, and long noisy reads.
   You can type '--err-free-seq your_ctg.fa --input your_long_reads.fa --err-free-nodes' to perform assembly somehow act as long-reads scaffolding
 --node-len <int>
   The default value is 1024, which is times of KBM_BIN_SIZE(always equals 256 bp). It specifies the length of intervals (or call nodes after selecting).
   kbm indexs sequences into BINs of 256 bp in size, so that many parameter should be times of 256 bp. There are: --node-len, --node-ovl, --aln-min-length, --aln-dovetail .   Other parameters are counted in BINs, --dp-max-gap, --dp-max-var .
 --node-matched-bins <int>
   Min matched bins in a node, default:1
 --node-ovl <int>
   Default: 256. Max overlap size between two adjacent intervals in any read. It is used in selecting best nodes representing reads in graph
 --node-drop <float>
   Default: 0.25. Will discard an node when has more this ratio intervals are conflicted with previous generated node
 -e <int>, --edge-min=<int>
   Default: 3. The minimal depth of a valid edge is set to 3. In another word, Valid edges must be supported by at least 3 reads
   When the sequence depth is low, have a try with --edge-min 2. Or very high, try --edge-min 4
 --drop-low-cov-edges
   Don't attempt to rescue low coverage edges
 --node-min <int>
   Min depth of an interval to be selected as valid node. Defaultly, this value is automaticly the same with --edge-min.
 --node-max <int>
   Nodes with too high depth will be regarded as repetitive, and be masked. Default: 200, more than 200 reads contain this node
 --ttr-cutoff-depth <int>, 0
 --ttr-cutoff-ratio <float>, 0.5
   Tiny Tandom Repeat. A node located inside ttr will bring noisy in graph, should be masked. The pattern of such nodes is:
   depth >= <--ttr-cutoff-depth>, and none of their edges have depth greater than depth * <--ttr-cutoff-ratio 0.5>
   set --ttr-cutoff-depth 0 to disable ttr masking
 --dump-kbm <string>
   Dump kbm index into file for loaded by `kbm` or `wtdbg`
 --load-kbm <string>
   Instead of reading sequences and building kbm index, which is time-consumed, loading kbm-index from already dumped file.
   Please note that, once kbm-index is mmaped by kbm -R <kbm-index> start, will just get the shared memory in minute time.
   See `kbm` -R <your_seqs.kbmidx> [start | stop]
 --load-seqs <string>
   Similar with --load-kbm, but only use the sequences in kbmidx, and rebuild index in process's RAM.
 --load-alignments <string> +
   `wtdbg` output reads' alignments into <--prefix>.alignments, program can load them to fastly build assembly graph. Or you can offer
   other source of alignments to `wtdbg`. When --load-alignment, will only reading long sequences but skip building kbm index
   You can type --load-alignments <file> more than once to load alignments from many files
 --load-clips <string>
   Combined with --load-nodes. Load reads clips. You can find it in `wtdbg`'s <--prefix>.clps
 --load-nodes <sting>
   Load dumped nodes from previous execution for fast construct the assembly graph, should be combined with --load-clips. You can find it in `wtdbg`'s <--prefix>.1.nodes
 --bubble-step <int>
   Max step to search a bubble, meaning the max step from the starting node to the ending node. Default: 40
 --tip-step <int>
   Max step to search a tip, 10
 --ctg-min-length <int>
   Min length of contigs to be output, 5000
 --ctg-min-nodes <int>
   Min num of nodes in a contig to be ouput, 3
 --minimal-output
   Will generate as less output files (<--prefix>.*) as it can
 --bin-complexity-cutoff <int>
   Used in filtering BINs. If a BIN has less indexed valid kmers than <--bin-complexity-cutoff 2>, masks it.
 --no-local-graph-analysis
   Before building edges, for each node, local-graph-analysis reads all related reads and according nodes, and builds a local graph to judge whether to mask it
   The analysis aims to find repetitive nodes
 --no-read-length-sort
   Defaultly, `wtdbg` sorts input sequences by length DSC. The order of reads affects the generating of nodes in selecting important intervals
 --keep-isolated-nodes
   In graph clean, `wtdbg` normally masks isolated (orphaned) nodes
 --no-read-clip
   Defaultly, `wtdbg` clips a input sequence by analyzing its overlaps to remove high error endings, rolling-circle repeats (see PacBio CCS), and chimera.
   When building edges, clipped region won't contribute. However, `wtdbg` will use them in the final linking of unitigs
 --no-chainning-clip
   Defaultly, performs alignments chainning in read clipping
   ** If '--aln-bestn 0 --no-read-clip', alignments will be parsed directly, and less RAM spent on recording alignments
